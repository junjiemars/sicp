## 1.2.1

### Recursive Process vs. Recursive Procedure
> In contrasting iteration and recursion, we must be careful not to
confuse the notion of a recursive process with the notion of a recursive
procedure . When we describe a procedure as recursive, we are referring
to the syntactic fact that the procedure definition refers (either directly
or indirectly) to the procedure itself. But when we describe a process
as following a pattern that is, say, linearly recursive, we are speaking
about how the process evolves, not about the syntax of how a procedure
is writen.
